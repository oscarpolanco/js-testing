# Testing course
The main goal of the practice is to introduce the testing on my developer skillset.

## Section 1: Intro to testing

A little definition of what is a [Bugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug) on software.

## How to prevent bugs

Here are some ways on how to prevent bugs:

- [Static types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system) => [flow](https://flow.org/)/[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Linting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)) => [Eslint](https://eslint.org/)
- Testing => The previous can't catch logic errors

## How to run the examples

- Need to install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Open your terminal
- Go to the file directory
- Use the `node` comand to run the file => `node todo.js`
